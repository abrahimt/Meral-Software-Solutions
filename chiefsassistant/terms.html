            <!-- Privacy Policy Section -->
            <section id="privacy">
                <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use our Clash of Clans Discord Bot (the "Bot"). By using the Bot, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

                <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
                <p>We only collect information that is necessary to provide and improve the Bot's functionality.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Discord Information:</strong> When you use the Bot, we may collect and store the following information provided by Discord's API:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>User IDs:</strong> To associate specific settings or data with a specific user.</li>
                            <li><strong>Server (Guild) IDs:</strong> To manage server-specific configurations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Channel IDs:</strong> To know where to send messages.</li>
                            <li><strong>Command Content:</strong> We process the content of messages that contain Bot commands to execute the requested action. We do not store the content of non-command messages.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li class="mt-2">
                        <strong>Clash of Clans Information:</strong> To provide its services, the Bot interacts with the official Supercell API. When you request data, we process:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Player Tags (e.g., #2PPQJ9YQ):</strong> To look up specific player profiles.</li>
                            <li><strong>Clan Tags (e.g., #Y090LL0):</strong> To look up specific clan profiles.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="mt-1">The Bot temporarily caches this game data to improve performance and reduce API calls, but it does not create permanent profiles of players or clans outside of user-configured settings.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="mt-2">
                        <strong>User-Provided Information:</strong> You may voluntarily provide information to the Bot, such as linking your Discord User ID to a specific Clash of Clans Player Tag for convenience. This information is stored to remember your preferences.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
                <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>To Operate the Bot:</strong> To respond to your commands and provide the requested information and features.</li>
                    <li><strong>For Configuration:</strong> To save and apply server-specific or user-specific settings.</li>
                    <li><strong>To Improve the Bot:</strong> To understand usage patterns, diagnose problems, and develop new features.</li>
                    <li><strong>For Support:</strong> To assist you with any issues you may encounter.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Data Storage and Security</h3>
                <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access. Data is stored on secure servers. However, no online service is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>

                <h3>4. Data Sharing</h3>
                <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. Your information may be disclosed in the following limited circumstances:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If required by law, such as in response to a subpoena or court order.</li>
                    <li>To protect our rights, property, or safety, or the rights, property, or safety of others.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Data Retention & Your Rights</h3>
                <p>We retain the data we collect for as long as it is necessary to provide the Bot's services.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Server/User Configurations:</strong> This data is retained until you or a server administrator removes the Bot from the server or uses a command to delete the configuration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Your Rights:</strong> You have the right to request the deletion of your user-specific data (such as a linked player tag). You can typically do this via a bot command or by contacting us for assistance.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6. Children's Privacy</h3>
                <p>Our Bot is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

                <h3>7. Changes to This Policy</h3>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy and updating the "Last Updated" date. We may also provide notice through the Bot itself or a support server.</p>

                <h3>8. Contact Us</h3>
                <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through our official support server <a href="#">[Link to your Discord Support Server]</a> or via email at <a href="mailto:email@example.com">[Your Contact Email]</a>.</p>
